HOBBIES
</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Fetch Master: I'm the undisputed king of fetch! I can catch a ball or a Frisbee like nobody's business, and I never get tired of playing. If you need a good fetch partner, I'm your guy.</li>
    <li>Snuggle Champion: Move over, world, there's a new snuggle champion in town! I'm a total snuggle bug and I'm not afraid to admit it. I love nothing more than curling up next to my humans and getting cozy. If you need a little extra warmth and love in your life, I'm your pup.</li>
    <li>Chew-tastic: I'm a chew master! Give me a good toy or a bone, and I'm in heaven. I can happily chew away for hours, keeping my teeth healthy and my mind occupied. If you need a good chew buddy, I'm your pup.</li>
